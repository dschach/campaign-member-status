<li>Label: Used in the List of Campaign Statuses in the Setup view in step 3 above. Recommended convention: TYPE-STATUS</li>
<li>Name: This is an API name that can be used by developers. Not required by this package. Recommended: let this autofill after you type in the Label</li>
<li>Campaign Type: This is the actual value for the Campaign&#39;s Type field.</li>
<li>Protected Status: This is the Status value that will become protected</li>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h2>
<p>Once everything is set up (above), Campaigns should maintain a consistent set of Campaign Member Statuses. Here&#39;s how we accomplish that.</p>
<h3 id="new-campaign-created">New Campaign Created</h3>
<p>When a new Campaign is created, we check to see if the Type of Campaign is defined in any of the Protected Campaign Member Status records (the Custom Metadata Type that was set up earlier). If there is a match, the solution will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automatically add a checkbox to the Campaign Custom Field &quot;Has Campaign Type Member Statuses&quot;.</li>
<li>Automatically adjust the CampaignMemberStatus records to match all Protected Campaign Member Statuses expected</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="editing-a-campaign-type-member-status">Editing a Campaign Type Member Status</h3>
<p>For a Campaign that &quot;Has Campaign Type Member Statuses&quot;, when one of the CampaignMemberStatus records is edited we will double check all statuses of that Campaign to make sure that all Protected ones still exist. If there are any missing, they will be recreated almost instantly (you may need to refresh the page for them to show up if there&#39;s a delay).</p>
<h3 id="removing-a-campaign-type-member-status">Removing a Campaign Type Member Status</h3>
<p>If a user removes a Campaign Type Member Status, the Scheduled Job (that was created as part of <a href="#post-install-configuration">Post-Install Configuration</a>) will search for Campaigns missing a Status and recreate it.</p>
<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<h3 id="why-dont-you-just-prevent-people-from-messing-around-with-protected-statuses">Why Don&#39;t you just prevent people from messing around with Protected Statuses?</h3>
<p>We really wish we could. A &quot;before update&quot; and &quot;before delete&quot; Apex Trigger would be the simplest way to handle this. Unfortunately, Apex Triggers are not (yet) possible on CampaignMemberStatus records, so we end up having to fix it after-the-fact.</p>
<h3 id="i-get-apex-test-errors-after-deploying-the-code-how-can-i-fix-them">I get Apex test errors after deploying the code. How can I fix them?</h3>
<p>If you have Apex tests which set up a Campaign record as part of the test, the functionality in this package will get called and might blow up. This is because how Salesforce internally treats the automatic generation of Campaign Member Status records when a new Campaign is created (it&#39;s weird).</p>
<p>You have 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>For the purpose of the test, disable this functionality. You can accomplish this by adding <code>CampaignTriggerHandler.bypass=true;</code> in your Apex Test set up.</li>
<li>To actually see the records that Salesforce would create, you would need to have your test <code>@isTest(seeAllData=true)</code>. There are a lot of considerations with this approach, so please use wisely.</li>
</ol>
