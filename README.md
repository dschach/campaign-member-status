## A solution for Protected Campaign Member Statuses and step-by-step instructions for use.

### Originally written by [Adam Erstelle](https://thespotforpardot.com/author/adamsercante-com/)

We go through all the effort of setting up beautiful Salesforce Campaigns, naming standards and maybe even a hierarchy. The next challenge in completing your beautiful work of campaign art is getting a hold on your Campaign Member Statuses for each campaign.

When a new Salesforce Campaign is created, many people aren't just happy with the two default statuses of Sent and Responded. This prompts them to create what they think makes the most sense. Though as time goes on and as reporting starts to be needed, everyone making their own Campaign Member Statuses can be a nightmare that prevents you from getting meaningful and actionable intelligence. It would be really nice to take the guesswork out of status reporting and have a standard set of Campaign Member Statuses everyone uses consistently.

Jenna Molby posted a [fantastic solution](https://jennamolby.com/how-to-automatically-create-campaign-statuses-in-salesforce/) that enables you to automatically create the right Statuses on Campaign creation. The automation here is good, though as you increase the number of Types the Flow could become a bit unwieldy.

Another thing that could be a problem comes later when other people might make changes to your carefully crafted structure. What happens if someone edits or even removes these statuses?

This code was developed for Marketing Admins who want to automate and enforce the Campaign Member Status options for Campaigns of certain types. It was originally written by Sercante LLC (https://github.com/sercante-llc/campaign-member-status).

## **Protected Campaign Member Statuses**

Protected Campaign Member Statuses is a solution to solve this problem of automating (and enforcing) Campaign Member Statuses by Type. It allows you to:

1.  Define the Campaign Member Statuses that should always be present on given Campaign Types.
2.  Restore the Protected Statuses on Active Campaigns should someone make changes.
3.  Create additional Statuses for specific reasons.
4.  Override by authorized users on a per-Campaign basis.

### Get started

Once installed, you need to define your Protected Statuses. This is done with Custom Metadata Types.

1.  Login to Salesforce Lightning, and go to Setup.
2.  Navigate to Custom Metadata Types, and click Manage Records for Protected Campaign Status.  
    ![Protected Campaign Member Statuses](doc-assets/assets/Pardot-Protected-Campaign-Member-Statuses-1.png)
3.  To create your first ones, click New  
    ![Protected Campaign Member Statuses](doc-assets/assets/Pardot-Protected-Campaign-Member-Statuses-2.png)
4.  Fill in the various fields.
    - `Label`: Used in the List of Campaign Statuses in the Setup view in step 3 above. Recommended convention:Â  TYPE-STATUS
    - `Name`: This is an API name that can be used by developers. Not required by this package. Recommended: let this autofill after you type in the Label.
    - `Campaign Type`: This is the actual value for the Campaign's Type field.
    - `Protected Status`: This is the Status value that will become protected.
    - `Is Default`: Select this if this Status should be the default (please pick only 1 per Type).
    - `Is Responded`: Select this if this Status should be marked as Responded.
    - When complete, your screen may look something like this:  
      ![Protected Campaign Member Statuses](doc-assets/assets/Pardot-Protected-Campaign-Member-Statuses-3.png)
5.  Click `Save` (or `Save & New`) and repeat a whole bunch.
6.  Lastly, time to set up a scheduled job to restore deleted protected statuses.
7.  Back in Setup, go to Apex Classes and click `Schedule Apex`.  
    ![Protected Campaign Member Statuses](doc-assets/assets/Pardot-Protected-Campaign-Member-Statuses-4.png)
8.  Fill in the few fields.
    - `Job Name`: give this a nice descriptive name so you remember what it is in 3 months.
    - `Apex Class`: CampaignMemberStatusJob
    - `Frequency`: set this to what works for you. We recommend running this daily during off-peak hours.
    - `Start`: today
    - `End`: some time in the distant future
    - `Preferred Start Time`: off peak hours
    - When complete, your screen may look something like this:  
      ![Protected Campaign Member Statuses](doc-assets/assets/Pardot-Protected-Campaign-Member-Statuses-5.png)

You are good to go once you have provided your statuses. Give it a whirl by creating a new Campaign with the Type you have set up. Then take a look at the statuses already created.

Campaigns with Types not already set up will keep the default two statuses that Salesforce creates.

## **That's cool.** **What's behind the curtain?**

To accomplish this, we leverage a few cool tools available to us:

- Custom Metadata Types: Allows the Protected Statuses to be treated like normal Salesforce metadata and can be deployed around like any other metadata (changesets, insert devops tool here)
- Campaign Custom Field: Campaign.Has_Protected_Campaign_Member_Statuses\_\_c is automatically checked by the solution if a Campaign is created and there are Custom Metadata Type records that specify this Campaign's Type. It is also what allows the rest of the code to keep the statuses intact. You can clear the checkbox for this field to make changes to the statuses if you need to. However, you can't enable protection afterwards.
- Change Data Capture: We turn this on for CampaignMemberStatus so we can detect edits to statuses and then fix the records after-the-fact. Sadly we can't (yet?) put any triggers on CampaignMemberStatus (which would have been ideal).
- Triggers: We use them to kick off the automation that we've built when a Campaign is created. We also use them to watch for Campaign Member Status edits (through the ChangeEvents from Change Data Capture) so we can set things right afterwardsd.

If you want even more details, check out the [original Github project](https://github.com/sercante-llc/protected-campaign-statuses) where you can see all the inner workings of what is going on.

## How it Works

Once everything is set up, Campaigns should maintain a consistent set of Campaign Member Statuses. Here's how we accomplish that.

### New Campaign Created

When a new Campaign is created, we check to see if the Type of Campaign is defined in any of the Protected Campaign Member Status records (the Custom Metadata Type that was set up earlier). If there is a match, the solution will:

1. Automatically add a checkbox to the Campaign Custom Field "Has Campaign Type Member Statuses".
1. Automatically adjust the CampaignMemberStatus records to match all Protected Campaign Member Statuses expected

### Editing a Campaign Type Member Status

For a Campaign that "Has Campaign Type Member Statuses", when one of the CampaignMemberStatus records is edited we will double check all statuses of that Campaign to make sure that all Protected ones still exist. If there are any missing, they will be recreated almost instantly (you may need to refresh the page for them to show up if there's a delay).

### Removing a Campaign Type Member Status

If a user removes a Campaign Type Member Status, the Scheduled Job (that was created as part of [Post-Install Configuration](#installation-instructions)) will search for Campaigns missing a Status and recreate it.

## FAQ

### Do you have any suggested statuses?

Of course! Here are a few to get your creative juices flowing.
![Suggested Campaign Member Statuses](doc-assets/assets/CMStatuses.png)

### Why Don't you just prevent people from messing around with Protected Statuses?

We really wish we could. A "before update" and "before delete" Apex Trigger would be the simplest way to handle this. Unfortunately, Apex Triggers are not (yet) possible on CampaignMemberStatus records, so we end up having to fix it after-the-fact.

### I get Apex test errors after deploying the code. How can I fix them?

If you have Apex tests which set up a Campaign record as part of the test, the functionality in this package will get called and might blow up. This is because how Salesforce internally treats the automatic generation of Campaign Member Status records when a new Campaign is created (it's weird).

You have 2 options:

1. For the purpose of the test, disable this functionality. You can accomplish this by adding `TriggerHandler.bypass('CampaignTriggerHandler` in your Apex Test set up.
2. To actually see the records that Salesforce would create, you would need to have your test `@isTest(seeAllData=true)`. There are a lot of considerations with this approach, so please use wisely.

# Installation Instructions

## What You Get

When deploying this package to your org, you will get:

- 1 Custom Metadata Type (and page layout)
- 1 Campaign Custom Field
- 1 ChangeDataCapture configuration
- 2 Apex Triggers
- 5 Production Apex Classes
- 3 Apex Test Classes

## Pushing Code to a Sandbox

Follow this set of instructions if you want to deploy the solution into your org without using an Unlocked Package. This will require a Sandbox, and then a ChangeSet to deploy into Production.

1. If you know about and use `git`, clone this repository

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/dschach/campaign-member-status.git
   cd campaign-member-status
   ```

1. Setup your environment

   - [Install Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)

   - or [install from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sfdx-cli)
     ```shell
     npm install --global sfdx-cli
     ```

1. Authorize your Salesforce org and provide it with an alias (**myorg** in the commands below)

   ```shell
   # Connect SFDX to a Sandbox Org
   sfdx force:auth:web:login -s -a myorg -r https://test.salesforce.com

   # if for some reason you need to specify a specific URL, use this slightly altered command, making the correct adjustments
   sfdx force:auth:web:login -s -a myorg -r https://mycompanyloginurl.my.salesforce.com
   ```

1. Run a series of commands to deploy each of the three parts, or skip to the next item to push them all at once

   Please install the Trigger Handler from the [triggerHandler](https://github.com/dschach/campaign-member-status/tree/main/triggerhandler/main/default/classes) directory or from its [original repository](https://github.com/dschach/salesforce-trigger-framework). Documentation for that is found in that repo's pages: [https://dschach.github.io/salesforce-trigger-framework](https://dschach.github.io/salesforce-trigger-framework).

   Or run this command in a terminal to deploy the required trigger handler

   ```shell
   sfdx force:source:deploy -p triggerhandler --tracksource
   ```

   Run this command in a terminal to deploy the main code

   ```shell
   sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app --tracksource -u myorg
   ```

   Run this command in a terminal to deploy the bundled sample custom metadata

   ```shell
   sfdx force:source:deploy -p unpackaged --tracksource -u myorg
   ```

1. Or just run one command to push all three parts in sequence

   ```shell
   sfdx force:source:push
   ```

1. You'll need a custom permission set to access the Campaign field, or just add it to an existing permission set and delete this one

   ```shell
   sfdx force:user:permset:assign -n Campaign_Type_Member_Status_Admin
   ```

1. Continue with [Post-Install Configuration](#installation-instructions)

## Installing into a Scratch Org

1. Set up your environment. The steps include:

   - Enable Dev Hub in your org
   - [Install Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm)

1. If you haven't already done so, authorize your hub org and provide it with an alias (**myhuborg** in the command below):

   ```shell
   sf login org --set-default-dev-hub --alias myhuborg
   ```

1. If you know about and use `git`, clone this repository

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/dschach/campaign-member-status.git
   cd campaign-member-status
   ```

1. Run the included script to create a scratch org and push the metadata

   ```shell
   . scripts/scratchorg.sh
   ```

1. Continue with [Post-Install Configuration](#installation-instructions)
